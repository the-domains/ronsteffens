# Close-out day in DRC.

Our close-out lunch at Chez TinTin alongside the rapids of the Congo River. Now the team is all loaded on a flight to Paris en route home to US. Another successful fire training mission thanks to the support of so many, here and at home. Where we are heading, after a night and day of flying.
